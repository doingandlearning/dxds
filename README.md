# Developer Experience (and Education) Design System (DXDS)

A collection of components that can be used to enhance tutorials to allow for better learning. 

## Components

For each component, I want to create an educational rationale, the component itself and how to use it.

| Component | Blog Post | Astro | Web component |
| -- | -- |-- |-- |
| Prior Knowledge | [Post](https://kevincunningham.co.uk/posts/prior-knowledge) | [Astro component](/components/Astro/Precheck.astro) | TODO |
| Embedded Code Editor | [Post](https://www.kevincunningham.co.uk/posts/on-embedding-code-editors) | TODO | TODO |
| Spoiler | [Initial Post](https://www.kevincunningham.co.uk/posts/spoiler-element) | TODO | TODO |
| Quiz | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| Exemplars | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| Callouts | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| Progress | TODO | TODO | TODO |
 
I would like these to be as versatile as possible and while I'm starting in Astro, I'm planning on using web components. I'm currently exploring Lit as a library to help with that.
